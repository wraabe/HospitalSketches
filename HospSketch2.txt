\sc{a} \sc{night}.
   Being fond of the night side of nature I was soon
promoted to the post of night nurse, with every
facility for indulging in my favorite pastime of
``owling." My colleague, a black eyed widow, re-
lieved me at dawn, we two taking care of the ward
between us, like the immortal Sairy and Betsey
``turn and turn about." I usually found my boys
in the jolliest state of mind their condition allowed,
for it was a known fact that Nurse Periwinkle ob-
jected to blue devils, and entertained a belief that
he who laughed most was unrest of recovery. At
the beginning of my reign, dumps and dismals
prevailed, the nurses looked anxious and tired, the
men gloomy or sad, and a general ``hark from the
tombs a doleful sound" style of conversation,
seemed to be the fashion,_a state of things which
caused one coming from a merry, social New Eng-
land town, to feel as if she had got into an ex-
hausted receiver, and the instinct of self preserva-
tion, to say nothing of a philanthropic desire to
serve the race, caused a speedy change in ward
No. 1. More flattering than the most gracefully
turned compliment, more grateful than the most
admiring glance, was the sight of those rows of
faces all strange to me a little while ago, now
lighting up with smiles of welcome as I came
among them, enjoying that moment heartily with
a womanly pride in their regard, a motherly affec-
tion for them all. The evenings were spent in
reading aloud, writing letters, waiting on and
amusing the men, going the rounds with Dr. P. as
he made his second daily survey, dressing my
dozen wounds afresh, giving last doses and mak-
ing them co[s?]y for the long hours to come, till the
nine o'clock bell rang, the gas was turned down,
the day nurses went off duty, the night watch
came on, and my nocturnal adventures began.{l
   My ward was no divided into three rooms,
and, under favor of the matron, I had managed to
sort out the patients in such a way that I had what
I called, ``my duty room," my ``pleasure room,"
and my ``pathetic room," and worked for each in
a different way. One I visited, armed with a dress-
ing tray full of rollers, plasters, and pins; another,
with books, flowers, games and gossip, a third
with teapots, lullabies, consolatin, and sometimes
a shroud. Wherever the sickest or most helpless
man chanced to be there, I held my watch, often vis-
iting the other rooms to see that the general watch-
man of the ward did his duty by the fires, and the
wounds, the latter needing constant wetting. Not
only on this account didI meander, but also to get
an occasional breath of fresher air than the close
room afforded; for owing to the stupidity of that
mysterious ``somebody" who does all the damage
in the world, the windows had been carefully
nailed down above, and the lower sashes could only
be raised in the mildest weather, for the men lay
just below. I had suggested a sumarry smash-
ing of a few panes here and there, when frequent
appeals to headquarters had proved unavailing,
and daily orders to lazy attendants had come to
nothing; no one seconded the motion however,
and the nails were far beyond my reach; for
though belonging to the sisterhood of ``minister-
ing angels," I had no wings, and might as well
have asked for Jacob's ladder, as a pair of steps in
that charitable chaos.{l
   One of the harmless ghosts who bore me company
during the haunted hours, was Dan the watchman,
whom I regarded with a certain awe, for though
so much together, I never fairly saw his face, and,
but for his legs, should never have recognized him,
as we never met by day. These legs were remark-
able, as was his whole figure, for his body was
short, ro[t?]und, and done up in a big jacket and
muffler, his beard hid the lower part of his face,
his hat brim the upper, and all I ever discovered
was a pair of sleepy eyes, and a very mild voice.
But the legs!_very long, very thin, very crooked
and feeble, looking like grey sausages in their tight
coverings, without a ray of pegiopishness about
them, and finsihed off with a pair of exp[e/a?]nsive,
green cloth shoes, very like Chinese janks, with the
sails down. This figure, gliding noiselessly about
the dimly lighted rooms, was strongly suggestive
ofthe spirit of a beer barrel mounted on cork-
screws, haunting the old hotel in search of its lost
mates, emptied and staved in long ago. Another
goblin, who [fr?]equently appeared to me, was the
attendant of the pathetic room, who being a faith-
ful soul, was often up to tend two or three men
weak an wandering as babies after the fever had
gone. This amiable creature beguiled the watches
of the night by brewing jorums of a fearful bev-
erage, which he called coffee, and insisted on shar-
ing with me, coming inwith a great bowl of some-
thing like mud soup, scalding hot, guiltless of
cream, rich in all pervading flavor of molasses,
scorch and tin pot. Such as amount of good will
and neighborly kindness also went into the mess,
that I never could find the heart to refuse, but al-
ways received it with thanks, sipped it with hyop-
critical relish while he remained, and whipped it
into the slop jar the instant he departed,_thereby
gratifying him, securing one rousing laugh in the
doziest hour of the night, and no one wasthe worse
for the transaction but the pigs. Whether they
were ``cut off untimely in their sins" or not, I care-
fully abstained from inquiring.{l
   It was a strange life{--}asleep half the day, ex-
ploring Washington the other half, and all night
hovering like a massive cherubim in a red rigolette
over the slumbering sons of man. I liked it, and
found many things to amuse, instruct an interest
me. The snores alone were quite a study, varying
from the mild sniff to the stentorian snort, which
startled the echoes and hoisted the performer erect
to accuse his neighbor of the deed, magnanimous-
ly forgive him, and, wrapping the drapery of his
couch about him, lie down to vocal slumber. After
listening for a week to this band of wind instru-
ments, I indulged in the belief that I could recog-
nize each by the snore alone, an was tempted to
join the chorus by breaking out with John Brown's
favorite hymn,{l
{\qquad}``Blow ye the trumpet, blow!"}q
   I would have given much to have possessed the
art of sketching, for many of the faces became won-
derfully interesting when unconscious. Some grew
stern and grim, the men evidently dreaming of
war as they gave orders,groaned over their wounds,
or damned the rebels vigorously; some grew sad
and infinitely pathetic, as if the pain borne silently
all day, revenged itself by now betraying what the
man's pride had concealed so well.{l
   Often the roughest grew young and pl[eas?]nt
when sleep smoothed the hard lines away, letting
the real nature [?]rt itself; many almost seemed
to speak, and I learned to know these men better
by night than through any intercourse by day.
Sometimes they disappointed me, for faces that
looked merry and good in the light, grew bad and
sly when the shadows came, and though they
made no confidences in words, I read their lives,
leaving them to wonder at the change of manner
this midnight magic wrought in their nurse. A
few talked busily, one drummer boy sang sweetly,
though no persuasions could win a note from him
by day, and several depended on being told what
they had talked of in the morning. Even my
constitutionals in the chilly halls, po[ssessed?] a cer-
tain charm, for the houe was never still. Senti-
nels tramped round it all night long their muskets
glittering in the wintry moonlight as they walked,
or stood before the doors straight and silent, as
figures of stone, causing one to conjure up re-
[m]antic visions of guarded forts, sudden surprises,
and daring deed; for in these war times the hum-
drum life of [Yankeedon?] has vanished, and the
most pro[??] feel some thrill of that excitement
which stirs the nation's heart and makes its capi-
tal a camp of hospitals. Wandering up and down
these lower halls, I often heard cries from above,
steps hurring to and fro, saw surgeons passing up
or men coming down carrying a stretcher, where
lay a long white figure whose face was shrouded
and whose fight was done. Sometimes I stopped
to watch the passers in the street, the moonlight
shinging on the spire opposite, or the gleam of
some vessel floating like a white winged sea gull
down the broad Potomac, whose fullest flow can
never wash away the red stain of the land.{l
   The night whose events I have a fancy to record
began with a little comedy, and ended with a great
tragedy, for a virtuous and useful life untimely
ended is always tragical to those who see not as
God sees. My head quarters were beside the bed
of a New Jersey boy, crazed by the horrors of
that dreadful Saturday. A slight wound in the
knee brought him there; but his mind had suf-
fered more than his body; some string of that
delicate machine was over strained, and for days,
he had been reliving in imagination the scenes he
could not forget, till his distress broke out in inco-
herent ravings pitiful to hear. As I sat by him
endeavoring to soothe his poor distracted brain by
the constant touch of wet hands over his hot fore-
head, he lay cheering his comrades on, hurrying
them back, then counting them as they fell around
him, often clutching my arm to drag me from the
vicinity of a bursting shell, or covering up his
head to screen himself from of shower of shot; his
face brilliant with fever, his eye restless, his head
never still, every muscle strained and rigid, while
an incessant stream of defiant shouts, whispered
warnings and broken laments poured from his lips
with that forceful bewilderment which makes such
wanderings so hard to overhear.{l
   It was past eleven and my patient was slowly
wearying himself into fitful intervals of quietude,
when, in one of these pauses, a curious sound ar-
rested my attention. Looking over my shoulder
I saw a one legged phantom hopping nimbly
down the room, and going to meet it, recognized
a certain Pennsylvania gentleman whose wound
fever, had taken a turn for the worse, and depriv-
ing him of the few wits a drunken campaign had
left him, set him literally tripping on the li[?]t fan-
tastic toe ``toward home," as he blandly informed
me, touching the military cap which formed a
somewhat striking contrast to the severe simplic-
ity of the rest of his decidedly undress uniform.
When sane, the lest movement produced a roar
of pain or a volley of oaths, but the departure of
reason seemed to have wrought an agreeable
change both in the man and his manners; for bal-
ancing himself on one leg like a meditative storck,
he plunged into an animated discussion of the
war, the President, lager beer, and Enfield rifles,
regardless of any suggestions of mine as to the
proprity of returning to bed lest he be court mar-
tialed for desertion. Anything more supremely
ridiculous can hardly be imagined th[?]n this figure
scantily draped in white, its one foot covered with
a big blue sock, a dingy cap [?]ct rakishly askew on
its shaven head, and placid satisfaction b[eam?]ing
in its broad red face as it flourished a mug in one
hand, an old boot in the other calling them can-
teen and knapsack, while it skipped and fluttered
in the most unearthly fashion. What to do with
the creature I didn't know; Dan was absent, and
if I went to find him the persi[?]bulator might fes-
toon himself out of the window, set his togs a-fire,
or do some of his neighbors a mischief. The at-
tendant of the room was sleeping like a near rela-
tive of the celebrated seven, and nothing short of
pins would rose him, for he had been out that day
and whiskey asserted its supremacy in balmy
whiffs. Still declaiming in a fine flow of elo-
quence, the demented gentleman hopped on blind
and deaf to my graspings and entreaties, and I
was about to slam the door in his face and run for
help, when a second and saner phantom ``all is
white," came to the re[?]c[?] in the likeness of a big
Prussian, who spoke no English, but divi[sed?] the
cri[?] [?] put [?] [?]d to it, by [bundling?] the [?]vely
[mousepad?] into his bed, [????]
itstive command to ``stay put"_which received
added weight from being delivered in an odd con-
glomeration of French and German, accompanied
by warning wags of a head decorated with a yel-
low cotton night cap, rendered most imposing by
a [tassel] like a bell-pull. Rather exhausted by his
brisk excursion, the member from Penn., [?]ed,
and after an irrepressible laugh together, my
Prussian ally and myself, were returning to our
places, when the echo of a sob caused us to glance
along the beds. It came from one in the corner_%

such a little bed! and such a tearful little face
looked up at us, as we stopped beside it! The
twelve years old drummer boy was sot singing
now, but sobbing with a manly effort all the
while to sti[fl?]e the distressful sounds that would
break out.{l
   {``}What is it Teddy?" I asked as he rubbed the
tears away and checked himself in the middle of a
great sob to answer plaintively_{l
   {``}I've got a chill, ma'am, but I aint cryin for
that, cuase I'm used to it. I dreamed Kit was
here, and when I waked up he wa[rn?]'t, and I
couldn't help it then."{l
   The boy came in with the rest, and the man who
was taken dead from the ambulance was the Kit
he mourned. Well he might, for, when the wound-
ed were brought from Fredericksburg, the child
lay ill is one of the ca[mps?] thereabout, and this
good friend, though sorely hurt himself, would not
leave him to the expo[su?]re and neglect of [such?] a
time and place, but, wrapping him in [his?] own
blanket, carrie him in his [?] to the transport,
tended him during the [passage?] and only yi[elde?]d
up his charge when death met him at the door of
the hospital which promised care and comfort for
the boy. For ten days, Teddy had shivered or
burned with fever and a[?], pis[?]g the while for
Kit, and refusing to be comforted, [becoming he had?]
not been able to thank him for the generous pro-
tection which perhaps had cost the gi[v?]er's life.
The vivid dr[?] seeed to have [wrung?] the child-
ish heart with a [fresh pang?] and when I [tried the?]
solace [?}d for his years, the rem[orseful ?] that
haunted him, found [?] is a fresh [burst of tears?]
as he looked at the [was?]ted hands I was un[d?]-
ing to warm.{l
   {``}Oh! if I'd only been [as?] this [when?] Kit carried
me asI am now, maybe he wouldn't have died;
but I was heavy, he was [kn?t] worser than we
knew, and so it killed him, and I didn't see him to
say good bye."{l
   This thought had troubled him in [secret?], and my
[?]rances that his friend would probably have
died at all events, hardly [mana?]ged the bitter[ness?] of
his regretful grief.{l
   At this juncture, the delirious man began to
shout, the one-legged rose up in his bed, as if pre-
paring for another [da?]rt, teddy bewa[?]led himself
more piteously than before, and if ever a woman
was at her wit's end, that d[istracted?] female was
Nurse Periwinkle during the space of two or three
minutes, as she vibrated between the three beds,
like an agitated pe[ndulum?]. Like a most opportune
reinforcement, Dan the [bandy?] appeared, and de-
voted himself to the lively party, leaving me free
to return to my post; for the Prussian, with a sod
and a sniffle, took the little lad away to his own bed,
and lulled him to sleep with a soothing murmur,
like a mammoth bumble bee. I liked that in Fritz,
and if he ever wondered afterward at the daomtoes
which sometimes found their way into his rations,
or the extra comforts of his bed, he might have
found a solution of the mystery in sundry persons'
knowledge of the fatherly action of that night.{l
   Hardly was I settled again, when the inevitable
bowl appeared, and its bearer delivered a message
I had expected, yet dreaded to receive:{l
   {``}John is going, ma'am, and wants to see you if
you can come."{l
   {``}The moment this boy is asleep; tell him so,
and let me know if I am in danger of being too
late."{l
   My G[?}nymede departed, and while I quieted
poor Shaw, I thought of John. He came in a day
or two after the others, and one evening, when I
entered my ``pathetic room," I found a lately emp-
tied bed occupied by a large, fair man, with a f{?]
face and the serenest eyes I ever met. One of the
earlier corners had often spoken of a friend who
had remained behind, that th[ose?] aparently worse
wounded then himself might reach a shelter first.
It seemed a David and Jonathan sort of friendship.
The man fre[tte?]d for his [?]e, and was never tired
of praising John,_his courage, sobriety, self-de-
nial and unfailing kindliness of heart, always
winding up with: ``He's an out an out fine feller,
ma'am, you see if he aint." I had some curiosity
to behold this piece of excellence, and when he
came, watched him for a night or two before I
made friends with him; for, to tell the truth, I
was a little afraid of the stately looking man, whose
bed had to be lengthened to accommodate his com-
manding stature, who seldom spoke, uttered no
complaint, asked no sympathy, but tranquilly ob-
served what went on about him; and, as he lay
high upon his pillows, no picture of dying states-
man or warrior was ever fuller of [re?]al dignity than
this Virginia blacksmith. A most attractive face
he had, framed in brown hair and beard, comely
featured and full of vigor as yet [??]udued by
pain; thoughtful and often beautifully mild while
watching the afflictions of others, as if entirely
forgetful of his own. His mouth was grave and
firm, with plenty of will and courage in its lines,
but a smile could make it as sweet as any woman's;
and his eyes were child's eyes, looking one fairly
in the face with a clear, straightforward glance,
which promised well for such as placed their faith
in him. He seemed to cling to life as if it were
rich in duties and delights, and he had learned the
secret of content. The only time I saw his com-
posue disturbed, was when my surgeon brought
another to examine John, who scrutinized their
faces with an anxious look, asking of the elder:
``Do you think I shall pull through, sir?" ``I hope
so, my man." And as the two passed on, John's
eye still followed him with an in[tentness?] which
would have won a clearer answer from them, had
they seen it. A momentary shadow f[??] over
his face, then came the usual serenity, as if in that
brief eclipse he had acknowledged the existence of
some hard possibility, and, [ask?]ing nothing yet
hoping all things, left the issue in God's hand, with
that submission which is true piety.{l
   The next sight, as I went my rounds with Dr.
P., I happened to ask which man in the room
probably[???]
[???]
   {``}Every breath he draws is like a stab; for the
ball pierced the left lung, broke a rib, and did no
end of damage here and there; so the poor lad can
find neither forgetfulness nor ease, because he must
lie on his wounded back or suffocate. It will be a
hard struggle, and a long one, for he possesses
great vitality, but even his temperatate life can't save
him; I wish it could."{l
   {``}You don't mean he must die, Dr.!"{l
   {``}Bless you, there's not the slightest hope for
him, and you'd better tell him so before long;
women have a way of doing such things comfort-
ably, so I leave it to you. He won't last more than
a day or two, at farthest."{l
   I could have sat down on the spot and cried
heartily, if I had not learned the wisdom of bot-
tling up one's [??] for [leisure?] moments. Such
an end seemed very hard for such a man, when
hald a do[zen?] worn out, worthless bodies round
him, were gathering up the re[mnants?] of wasted
lives to linger on for years, perhaps burdens to
others, [???]. The army
needed men like John, earnest, brave and faithful;
fighting for liberty and justice with both heart and
hand, a true soldier of the Lord. I could not give
him up so soon, or think with any [patience?] of so
excellent a nature robbed of its fulfilment, and
[blundered?] into eternity by the [??] or stupid-
ity of those at whose hands so many lives may
be required. It was an easy thing for Dr. P. to
say_``Tell him he must die"_but a cr[uelt?]y hard
thing to do, and by no menas [as?] ``comfortable"
as he politely suggested. I had not the heart to
do it then, and privately la[?] the hope that
some change for the better might take place in
spite of gloomy prop[?]; no [rendering?] my [?]
unneccessary. A few minutes later, as I came in
again with [?] rollers I saw John [?]
with no one to support him, while the surgeon
dressed his back; I had never [supposed?] [?] it
do[n?]e before for having [?] wounds to attend
to and knowing the [fidelity?] of the [attendant?], I
had left John to him, thinking it might be more
agreeable and safe, for both strength and experi-
ence were needed in his case_I ha forgotten that
the strong man might long for the g[?] [?]
ance?] of a woman's hands, the sympathetic [mag-?]
[?] of a woman's presence, as well as the [?]
[?] souls about him. The [?]tor's words c[?]
[?] to reproach myself with [?]ect, not of any
real duty perhaps, but of those little cares and
kindnesses that solace homesick spirits, and [?]
the heavy hours p[?]. John looked lonely
and forsaken just then, as he sat with bent head,
hands folded on his knee, and no outward sign of
suffering, till, looking nearer, I saw great tears
roll down and drop upon the floor. It was a new
sight there, for though I had seen many suffer;
some swore, some groaned, most endured silently,
but none wept. Yet it did not seem weak, only very
touching, and straightway my [?] vanished, my
heart opened wide and took [John?] in, [?] gathering
the best head in my armsas freely as if he had
been a little child, I said, ``Let me help you bear it,
John."{l
   Never, on any human countenance, have I seen
so swift and beautiful a look of gratitude, suprise
and comfort, as that which answered me more el-
oquently than the whispered_{l
   {``}Thank you ma'am, this is right good! this
is what I wanted!"{l
   {``}Then why not ask for it before?"{l
   {``}I didn't like to be a trouble, you seemed [so?]
busy and I could manage to get on alone."{l
   {``}You shall not want it any more, John."{l
   Nor did he, for now I understand the w[ish?]ful
look that sometimes followed me, as I went out,
after a brief pause beside his bed, or merely a p[??]-
ing nod, while busied with those who seemed to
need me more than he, because more [urgent?] in
their demands; now I knew that to him, as to so
many, I was the poor substitute for motehr, wife,
or sister, and in his eyes no stranger, but a friend
who hitherto had seemed neglectful; for, in his
modesty, he had never g[??] the c[??]. This
was changed now, and through the tedious [oppre-?]
sion of probing, b[?]ing, and dressing his wounds,
he [leaned?] against me holding my hand [??], and if
palm wrang further scars from him, no one saw
them fall but me. When he was laid down again,
I hovered about him in aremorseful state of mind
that would not let me rest, till I had b[??] his
face, brushed his ``b[?] brown hair," [?] all
things smooth about him, and laid [?] of h[?]
and [heliotrope?] on his [?] pillow. While [?]
this, he watched me with the [?] ex[pression?]
I so liked to see, and when I offered the little [???-]
gay, h[?]ld [it?] carefully in his [great?] hand, [smoothed?]
a r[uffle?]d leaf or two, [surveyed?] and [??]t it [with?] an
air of genuine delight, [?] lay [contente?]dly [regar?]d-
ing the glimmer of the [machine?] on the green. Al-
though the [manliest?] man among my forty, he said
``Yes ma'am," like a little boy, received [??]
tions for his comfort with the quick smile that
brightened his whole face; and now and then, as
I stood tidying the table by his bed, I felt him
softly touch my gown as if to assure himself that I
was there. Anything more natural and frank I
never saw, and found this brave John as bashful as
brave, yet full of excellencies and [fi?]ne [?]pirations,
which, having [no?] pwer to exp[ress?] themselves in
words, seemed to have bloomed into his [character?]
and made him what he was.{l
   After that night, an hour of each evening that
remained to him was devoted to his case or pleas-
ure. He could not talk much, for [breath?] was
precious and he spoke in whispers, but from [occa-?]
sional conversations I gleaned scraps of private his-
tory which only added to the [affection and?] respect
I felt for him. Once h aske me to write a letter,
and as I settled pen and paper, I [said?] wth [an?] irre-
ressible glimmer of feminine curiosity, ``Shall it
be addressed to wife, or mother, John?"{l
   {``}Neither ma'am, I've got no wife, and will write
to mother myself when I get metter. Cid you think
I was married because of this?" [he asked?], touch-
ing a plain ring he wore, and often turned thought-
fully on his finger which he lay [??].{l
   {``}Partly that, but more from a settled sort of look
you have, a look which young men seldom get un-
til they marry."{l
   {``}I didn't know that, but I'm not so very young,
ma'am, thirty in May, and have been what you
might call settled this ten years, for mother's a
widow, I'm the oldest child she has, and it
wouldn't do for me to marry till Li[?]y has a home
of her own, and Laurie's learned his tranade, for
[we've?] [?? all line blacked out]
   {``}No doubt but you are both, John, yet how
came you to go to war if you felt so? Wasn't [en-?]
listing as bad as marrying?"{l
   {``}No, ma'am, not as I see it, for one is helping
my neighbor, the other pleasing myself. I w[?]nt
because I couldn't help it. I didn't want the glory
or the pay, I wanted the right thing done, and peo-
ple kept saying the [men?]  who were in [earnest?]
ought to fight. I was in [e?]arnest, the Lord knows!
but I held off as long as I could, not knowing
which was my duty; mother saw the [???], gave
me her ring to keep me [stead?]y, and said ``Go;" so
I went."{l
   A short story and a [si?]mple one, but the man
and the mother were po[??]ed [better than pages?]
of fine writing could have done it.{l
   {``}Do you ever regret that you came when you lie
here suffering so much?"{l
   {``}Never, ma'am; I haven't helped a [great?] deal,
but I've shown I was willing to give my life, and
perhaps I've got to; but I don't blame anybody,
and if it was to do over again, I'd do it. I'm a
little sorry I wasn't wounded in front; it looks
cowardly to be hit in the back, but I obeyed or-
ders, and it don't matter in the end, I know."{l
   Poor John! it did not [matter?] now, [except that?]
a shot in front might have [?] the long [agony?]
in store for him. He seemed to read the thought
that troubled me, as he spoke so hopefully when
there was no hope, for he suddenly added:{l
   {``}This is my first battle; do they think it's going
to be my last?"{l
   {``}I'm afraid they do, John."{l
   It was the hardest question I had ever been called
upon to answer; [double?] hard with these clear eyes
fixed on mine, forcing a truthful [answer?] by their
own truth. He seemed a little startled at first, pon-
dered over the [fateful?] fact a moment, then [shook?]
his head with a [glance?] at the [???]
cular limbs stretched [out before him.?]{l
   {``}I'm [not afraid, but it's difficult to ?? all ??]
[??]. I'm so [??? line too dark]
a little wound to kill me."{l
   [Merry Mercatle's?] dying words [gl?? through}
my [?? so he spoke?]_``[I'm not so ??]
well, nor so wideas a [??], [but the ??]
And John would have {?] the [?]
seen the ominous bl[?] [?]
[ders?], he never saw; and [??] the [??]
about him, could not believe his own [wound?] [?]
fatal than these, for tall the [suffering?] [????]
   {``}Shall I write to your mother now?" I asked,
thinking that these sudden tid[?s might change
all plans and purposes; but they did not; or the
man received the order if the Divine C[ommander?]
to march with the same unquestioning ob[?]
with which the soldier had [? ?] that of the hu-
man one, doubtess remembering that the [first had?]
him to life, the [l?]ast to death.{l
   {``}No ma'am; to L[?]rie just the same; he'll
break it to her best, and I'll add a [line?] to her my-
self when you get done."{l
   So I wrote the letter which he dictated, [?]
it better than say I had sent, for though here and
there a little ungrammatical or in[?], each
sentence came to me briefly worded but most ex-
pressive, full of excellent cou[?]el to the boy, [ten?]-
derly bequeathing ``mother and Lizzie" to his care,
and bidding him good bye in words the [??] for
their simplicity. He added a few lines with [??]dy
hand, and, as I sealed it, said, with a patient sort
of sigh, ``I hope the answer will come in time for
me to see it;" then, [turning away his ??]
flowers against his [lips, as if to hide ?]
of emotion at the thought of such a [sudden ?]
dering of all the [dear ?].{l
   These things had happened [two days before],
now John was dying and the [letter had not come.]
I had been summoned to many death [beds in my]
life, but to none that made my heart ache [as it did]
then, since my mother called me to [watch the de-]
parture of a spirit [? to this in its ?]
and patient strength. As I went i[n, John stretched??]
out both hands.{l
   {``}I knew you'd come! I [guess] Im [moving on,?]
ma'am."{l
   He was, and so rapidly that even [while he ?]
over his face I saw the [grey veil falling ?]
human [bond?] can lift. I [sat down by him, wiped?]
the drops from his forehead, [? the ? about]
him with the slow wave of a [? and ? to]
help him die. He stood in [? ? of help_and]
I could do so [little;_for, as the ? had ?]
fought every inch of the way, [f?ing] him to
draw each breath with a [?, and ? his]
hands with an [?? as if he ?]
``How long must I endure [this and be ? ?"]
For hours he [suffered deeoly without a ?]
respite, or a [moments murmuring; his ? grew?]
cold, his face damp, [his lips white, and ? and]
again, be sore the [e?ing off his ? ? the]
lightest weight added to his [? you ? it]
all, his eyes never lost their perfect [? and]
the man's soul seemed to sit [??]
by the ills that vexed his [flesh.]{l
   One by one, the [?? and ??]
app[eared] a circle of [pale faces and ? eyes,]
full of awe and pity; for [though a ??]
was beloved by all. [????-]
dered as his [?, ? his ??]
his fortitude, and now [? his hand ?]
for the in[?] of [an upright ? had ?]
itself deeply felt even in [? ? ?. ?]
the Jonathan who so loved this [? ?]
came creeping from his [bed ? ? ? ? ?]

choke in his voice, the {? of his hand, ?]
but there {? no ?, and the ? of the]
friends was the more [? for its ?]{l
   {``}Old boy, how are you?: [? the ?]{l
   {``}M[? tho? ? ?? the]

   {``}I will! I will!"{l
   {``}Good bye, [?]."{l
   {``}Good bye, John, good bye!"{l
   They kissed each other [tenderly / ? ?]
parted; for poor Nel [could not ? to ? his com-]
rade die. For a littlewhile, there was [? ?] in
the room but the drip of water [? ? ? ?]wly
