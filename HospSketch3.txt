   {``}My dear girl, we shall have you sick in
your bed, unless you keep yourself warm
and quiet for a few days. Widow Wadman can
take care of the ward alone, now the men are so
comfortable, and have her vacation when you are
about again. Now do be prudent in time, and
don't let me have to add a Periwinkle to my bou-
quet of patients."{l
   This advice was delivered in a paternal manner
by the youngest surgeon in the hospital, a kind=
hearted little gentleman who seemed to consider
me a frail young blossom that needed much cher-
ishing, instead of a tough old pinster who had
been knocking about the world for thirty years.
At the time I write of he discovered me sitting on
the stairs, with a nice cloud of unwholesome steam
rising from the washroom, a party of January
breezes disporting themselves in the halls, and per-
fumes by no means from ``Araby the blest," keep-
ing them comany while I enjoyed a fit of cough-
ing which caused my head to spin in a way that
made the application of a cool banister both neces-
sary and agreeable, as I waited for the froli/'csome
winds to restore the breath I'd lost; cheering my-
self eantime with a secret conviction that pneu-
monia was waiting for me round the corner. This
piece of advice had been offered by several persons
for a week, and refused by me with the obstinacy
with which my sex is so richly gifted; but the last
few hours had developed several surprising inter-
nal and external phenomena, which impressed up-
on me the fact that if I didn't make a masterly re-
treat very soon, I should [tumble?] down somewhere
and have to be borne ignominiously from the field.
My head felt like a cannon ball, my feet had a ten-
dency to cleave to the floor, the walls at times un-
dulated in a most disagreeable manner, people
looked unnaturally big,and the ``very bottles on the
mantel shelf" appeared to dance derisively before
my eyes. Taking these things into consideration,
while blinking stupidly at Dr. Z., I resolved to re-
tire gracefully if I must; so with a valedictory to
my boys, a private lecture to Mrs. Wadman, and a
fervent wish that I could take off my body and
work in my soul, I mournfully ascended to my
apartment, and Nurse I[?] was reported off duty.{l
   For the benefit of any ardent damsel whose [pa-?]
triotic fancy may have surrounded hospital life
with a halo of charms, I will briefly describe the
bower to which[td: w \td] I retired in a somewhat ruinous
condition. It was well ventilated, for five panes[td: a \td] of
glass had suffered compound fractures which all
the surgeouns and nurses had failed to heal; the
two windows were draped with sheets, the church
hospital opposite being a brick and mortor Argus,
and the female mind cherishing prejudices in favor
of retiracy during the night-capped periods of ex-
istence. A bare floor supported two narrow iron
beds spread with thin matresses like plasters, and
furnished with pillows in the last stages of con-
sumption. In a fire-place guiltless of shovel,
tongs, andirons, or grate, burned[td: e \td] a log inch by
inch, being too long to go on all at once, so
while the fire blazed away at one end I did the
same at the other, as I tripped over it a dozen
times a day, and flew up to poke it a dozen times
a night. A mirror (let us be elegant[?]) of the di-
mensions of a muffin and about as reflective, hung
over a tin basin, blue pitcher and brace of yellow
mugs. Two invalid tables, ditto chairs[td: r \td],  wan-
dered here and there, and the closet contained
a varied collection of bonnets, bottles, bags, boots,
bread and butter, boxes and b[u?]gs. This closet
was a regular Blue Beard cupboard to me, I al-
ways opened it with fear and trembling, owing to
rats, and shut it in anguish of spirit, for time and
space were not to be had, and chaos reigned along
with the rats. Our chimney-piece was decorated
with a flat-iron, a Bible, a candle minus stick, a
lavender-bottle, a new tin pan so brilliant that it
served excellently for a [pier?]-glass, and such of the
portly black bugs as preferred a warmer climate
than the rubbish hole afforded. Two [a?]rks, common-
ly called trunks, lurked behind the door, containing
the worldly goods of the twain who laughed and
cried, slept and scrambled in this refuge, while
from the whitewashed walls above either bed looked-
ed down[td: o \td] the pictured faces of hose whose memory
can make for us{l
{\qquad}``One little room a[n?] everywhere."}q
   For a day or two I managed to appear at meals,
for the human grub must eat till the butterfly is
ready to break loose, and no one had time to come
up two flights while it was possible for me to
come down. Far be it from me to add another af-
fliction or reproach to that much enduring man,
the steward; for compared with his predecessor
he was a horn of plenty; but{--}I put it to any can-
did mind{--}is not the following bill of fare suscep-
tible of improvement without plunging the nation
madly into debt? The three meals were ``pretty
much of a muchness," and consisted of beef evi-
dently put down for the men of '76; pork just in
from the street; army bread, composed of saw-
dust and [saleratus?]: butter, salt as if churned by
Lot's wife; stewed blackberries, so like preserved
cockroaches,that only those devoid of imagina-
tion could partake thereof with relish; coffee, mild
and muddy; tea, three dried huckleberry leaves to
a quart of water; water flavored with lime, also
animated and unconscious of any approach to
clearness. Variety being the spice of life, a small
pinch of the article would[td: ul \td] have been appreciated
by the hungry hard-working sisterhood, one of
whom,though accustomed to plain fare, soon found
herself reduced to bread and water; having an in-
born repugnance to the fat of the land, and the
salt of the earth.{l
   Another peculiarity of these hospital meals was
the rapidity with which the edibles vanished, and
the impossibility of getting a drop or crumb after
the usual time. At the first ring of the bell, a
general stampede took place; some twenty hungry
souls rushed to the dining room, swept over the
table like a swarm of locusts, and left no fragment
for any tardy creature who arrived fifteen minutes
late. Thinking it of more importance that the pa-
tients should be well and comfortably fed[td: d \td], I took
my time about my own meals for the first day or
two after I came, but was speedily enlightened by
Isaac, the black waiter, who bore with me a few
times, and then informed me, looking as stern as
fate:_{l
   {``}I say, ma'am, ef you comes so late you can't
have no vittles,_'cause I'm 'bleeged fer ter git
things ready fer de doctors mazin' spry arter you
nusses and foks is done. Do gen'lmen don't kere
fer ter wait, no more does I, so you jes' please ter
come at de time, and dere wont be no freetin' no
wheres."{l
   It was a new sensation to stand looking at a full
table, painfully conscious of one of the vacuums
which nature abhors, and receive orders to right
about face, without partaking of the nourishment
which your inner woman clamorously demanded.
The doctors always fared better than we, and for
a moment a desperate impulse prompted me to
give them a hint by walking off with the mutton,
or confiscating the pie. But Ike's eye was on me,
and to my shame be it spoken, I walked meekly
away, went dinnerless that day, and that evening
went to market, laying in a small stock of crack-
ers, cheese and apples, that my boys might not be
neglected, nor myself obliged to bolt solid and
liquid dyspepsias or starve. This plan would
have succeeded admirably had not the evil star
under which I was born, been in the ascendant
during that month, and cast its malign influences
even into my ``\/'uble" larder; for the rats had
their dessert off my cheese, the bugs set up house=
keeping in my cracker-bag, and the apples like all
worldly riches took to themselves wings and flew
away; whither no man could tell, though certain
black imps might have thrown light upon the
matter, had not the plaintiff in the case been loth
to add another to themany trials of long suffering
Africa. After this failure I resigned myself to fate,
adn remembering that bread was called the staff of
life, leaned pretty exclusively upon it; but it
proved a broken reed, and I came to the ground
after a few weeks of prison fare varied[td: v \td] by an oc-
casional potato or surreptitious sip of milk.{l
   Very soon after leaving the care of my ward I
discovered that I had no appetite, and cut the
bread and butter interests almost entirely, trying
the exercise and sun cure instead. Flattering my-
self that I had plently of time, and could see all
that was to be seen, as far as a lone lorn female
could venture in a city, one-half of whose male
population seemed to be taking the other half to
the guard-house,_every morning I took a brisk
run in one direction or anoterh, for the January
days were mild as Spring. A rollicking north
wind and occasional snow storm would have braced
and and refreshed tired body and soul, the other
have purified the ai[r?] and spread a clea coverlid
over the bed wherein the capital of these United
States appeared to be dozing pretty soundly just
then.{l
   One of these trips was to the Armory Hospital,
the neatness, comfort, and convenience of[td: o \td] which
makes it an honor to its presideing genius, and
arouse all the covetous propensities of such nurses
as came from other hospitals to visit it.{l
   The long, clean, warm and airy wards built bar-
rack-fashion, with the nurse's room at the end,
were fully appreciated by Nurse Periwinkle, whose
ward and private bower were cold, dirty, inconve-
nient, up stairs and down stairs and in every body's
chamber. At the Armory in ward K, I found a
cheery, bright-eyed, white-aproned little lady,
reading at her post near the stove; matting under
her feet, a draft of fresh air flowing in above her
head, a table full of trays, glasses, and such mat-
ters on one side, a large well stocked medicine
chest on the other, and all her duty seemed to be
going about now and then to give doses, issue or-
ders, which well trained attendants executed, and
pet, advise, or comfort Tom, Dick, or Harry, as
she[td: e \td] found best. As I watched the proceedings, I
recalled my own tribulations, and contrasted the
two hospitals in a way that would have caused
my summary dismissal, could it have been report-
ed at headquartres. Here order, method, common
sense, and liberality reigned and ruled in a style
that[td: tha \td] did one's heart good to see; at the Hurlybur-
ly Hotel, disorder, discomfort, bad management,
and no visible head, reduced things to a condition
which I despair of describing. The circumloc[?]-
tion fashion prevailed, forms and fusses tormented
our souls, and unnecessary strictness in one place
was counterbalanced by unpardonable laxity in
another. Here is a sample: I am dressing Sam
Dammer's shoulder, and having cleansed the
wound, look about for some strips of adhesive
plaster to hold on the little square of wet linen
which is to cover the gun-shot wound; the case is
not in the tray; Frank, the sleepy, half-sick atten-
dant knows nothing of it; we rummage high and
low, Sam is tired and fumes, Frank dawdles and
yawns, the men advise and laugh at the flurry, I
feel like a boiling teakettle with the lid ready to fly
off and damage somebody.{l
   {``}Go[td: G \td] and borrow some from the next ward, and
spend the rest of the day in finding ours," I
finally command. A pause, then Frank scuffles
back with the message_``Miss Peppercorn ain't
got none, and says you ain't no business to lose
your own duds and go borrowin' other folkses."
I say nothing for fear of saying too much, but fly
to the surgery. Mr. Toddypestle informs me that
I can't have anything without an order from the
surgeon of my ward. Great heavens! where is
he? and away I rush up and down, here and there,
till at last I find him in a state of bliss over a com-
plicated amputation in the fourth story. I make
my demand_he answers. ``In five minutes,"
and works away with his head upside down as he
ties an artery, saws a bone, or does a little needle=
work with a visible relish and very sanguinary
pair of hands. The five minutes grow to fifteen
and Frank appears with the remark that ``Dam-
mer wants to know what in thunder you are
keeping him there with his finger on a wet rag for?"
Dr. P. tears himself away long enough to scrib-
ble the order, with which I plunge downward to
the surgery again, find the door locked and while
hammering on it am told that two friends are wait-
ing to see me in the hall. The matron being away
her parlor is locked, and[td: n \td] there is no where to see
my guests but in my own room, and no time to en-
joy them till the plaster is found. I settle this
matter and circulate through the house to find
Toddypestle who has no right to leave the surgery
till night. He is discovered in the dead house
smoking a cigar, and very much the worse for his
researches among the spiritous preparations that
all the surgery shelves. He is inclined to be gal-
lant, and puts the finishing blow to the fire of my
wrath, for the teakettle lid flies off, and driving
him before me to his post, I fling down the order,
take what I choose and leaving the absurd incapa-
ble, kissing his and to me, depart feeling as
Grandma Riglesty is reported to have done when
she vainly sought for chips in Bimleck Jackwood's
``shifless paster."{l
   I find Dammer a well acted charadeof his own
name, and just as I get him done, struggling the
while with a burning desire to clap an adhesive
strip across his mouth full of heaven defying oaths,
Frank takes up his boot to put it on and exclaims_{l
   {``}I'm blest ef here ain't that case now! I recol-
lect seeing it pitch in this mornin,' but fergot all
about it till my heel went smash inter it. Here
ma'am, ketch hold on it and give the boys a sheet
on't all round 'gainst it tumbles into tother boot
next time yer want it."{l
   If a look could annihilate,Francis Saucebox would
have ceased to exist, but it couldn't, therefore he
yet lives to aggravate some unhappy woman's
soul, and wax fat in some equally congenial situa-
tion.{l
   Now while I'm freeing my mind, I should like to
enter my protest against employing convalescents
as attendants instead of strong, properly trained,[td: n \td]
and cheerful men. How it may be in other places
I cannot say, but here it was a source of constant
trouble and confusion, these feeble, ignorant men
trying to sweep, scrub, lift, and wait upon their
sicker comrades. One with a diseased heart was
expected to run up and down stairs, carry heavy
trays, and move helpless men; he tried it and grew
rapidly worse than when he first came,\,and when
he was ordered out to march away to the conval-
escent hospital, fell in a sort of fit before he turned
the corner and was brought back to die. Another
hurt by a fall from his horse, endeavored to do
his duty but failed entirely, and the wrath of the
ward master fell upon the nurse who must either
scrub the rooms herself or\,to take the lecture, for
the boy looked stout and well, and the master
never happened to see him turn white with pain, or
hear him groan in his sleep when an involuntary
motion strained his poor back. Constant com-
plaints were being made of incompetent attend-
ants, and some dozen woomen did\,double duty, and
then were blamed for breaking down. If any hos-
pital director fancies this a good and economical[td: l \td]
arrangement, allow one used up nurse to tell him,
it isn;t, and beg him to spare the sisterhood who
sometimes in their sympathy forget that they are
mortal, and run the risk of being made immortal,
sooner than is agreeable to their partial friends.{l
   Another of my few rambles took me to the Sen-
ate chamber, hoping to hear and see if this large
machine was run any better than some small ones
I knew of. I was too late and found the Speaker's
chair occupied by a colored gentleman of ten,
while two others were ``on their legs," having a
hot debate on the cornball question, as they gath-
ered the waste paper strewn about the floor into
bags, and several white members played leap-frog
over the desks, a much wholesomer relaxation than
some of the older Senators indulge in, I fancy.
Finding the coast clear,\,I likewise gambolled up
and down, from gallery to gallery; sat in Sum-
ner's chair and cudgelled an imaginary Brooks
within an inch of his life; examined Wilson's
book[td: s \td] in the coolest possible manner; warmed my
feet at one of the national registers; read peoples
names on scattered envelopes, and pocketed a
cast away autograph or two; watched the some-
what unparliamentary proceedings going on about
me, and wondered who in the world all the sedate
gentlemen were, who kept popping out of odd
doors here and there, like respectable Jacks-in-the-
box. Then I wandered over the ``palatial resi-
dence" of Mrs. Columbia, and examined its many
beauties, though I can't say I thought her a tidy
housekeeper, and didn't admire her taste in pic-
tures; for the eye of this humble individual soon
wearied of expiring patriots, who all appeared to
be quitting their earthly tabernacles in convulsions,
ruffled shirts and a whirl of torn banners, bomb
shells, and buff and blue arms and legs. The [sta?]t-
uary also was ``massive and concrete," but rather
wearing to examine; for the colossal ladies and
gentlemen, carried no cards of introduction[td: in \td] in face
or figure, so whether the meditative party in a
kilt, with well developed legs, shoes like army slip-
pers, and a ponderous nose, was Columbus, Cato,
or Cockelorum Tibby, the tragedian, was more
than I could tell. Several robust[td: t \td ladies attracted
me, as I felt particularly ``wimbly" myself, as old
country women say; but which was America and
which Pocahontas was a mystery, for all affected
much looseness of costume, disbevelment of hair,
swords, arrows, lances, scales, andother orna-
ments quite pass[?] with damsels of our day, whose
effigies should go down to posterity armed with
fans, crochet needles, riding whips, and parasols,
with here and there one holding pen or pencil,
rolling pin or broom. The statue of Liberty I rec-
ogized at once, for it had no pedestal as yet_but
stood flat in the mud, with young America most
sym\/bolically making dirt pies, and chip forts in
its shadow. But high[td: high \td] above the squabbling little
throng and their[td: ir \td] petty[td: pe \td] plans, the sun shone full on
Liberty's broad forehead, and in her hand,
some summer bird had built its nest, I accepted
the good omen then, and on the first of January,
the Emancipation Act gave the statue a nobler and
more enduring pedestal than any marble or gran-
ite ever carved and quarried by human hands.[l
   One trip to Georgetown Heights, where cedars
sighed overhead, dead leaves rustled underfoot,
pleasant paths led up and down, and a brook
wound like a silver snake, by the blackened ruins
of some French Minister's house, through the poor
gardens of the black washerwomen who congre-
gated there, and passing the cemetary with a
murmurous lullaby, rolled away to pay its little
tribute to the river. This breezy run was the last
I took, for on the morrow came r[?]in, and wind,
and confinement soon proved a powerful reinforce
ment to the enemy, who was quietly preparing to
spring a mine and blow me five hundred miles from
the position I had taken in what I called my Chick-
ahominy Swamp.{l
   Shut up in my room with no voice, spirits, or
books, that week was not a holiday, by any means.
Finding meals a humbug, I stopped away alto-
gethter, trusting that if this sparrow was of any
worth, the Lord would not let it fall to the ground.
Like a flock of friendly ravens, my sister nurses
fed me, not only with food for the body but kind
words for the mind; and soon from being half
starved, I found myself so bete[?]ed and betoasted,
petted and served that I was quite ``in the lap of
luxury," in spite of cough, headache, a painful
consciousness of my pleura, and a realizing sense
of bones in the human frame. From the pleasant
house on the hill, the home in the heart of Wash-
ington, and the Willard caravansary, cam friends
new and old with bottles, baskets, carriages and
invitations for the invalid, and daily our Florence
Nightingale climbed the steep stairs, stealing a
moment from her busy life to watch over the stran-
ger, of whom she was as thoughtfully tender as
ay mother. Long may she wave! whatever oth-
ers may think or say, Nurse Periwinkle is forever
grateful, and among her relics of that Washington
defeat, none is more valued than the little book
which appeared upon her pillow, one dreary day,
for the D. D. written in it means to her far more
than Docor of Divinity.{l
   Being forbidden to meddle with fleshly arms and
legs, I solaced myself by mending cotton ones,
and as I sat sewing at my window, watched the
moving panorama that oassed below; amusing
myself with taking notes of the most striking fig-
ures in it. Lon trains of army wagons kept up
a perpetual rumble from morning till night, am-
bulances rattled to and fro with busy surgeons,
nurses taking an airing, or convalescents going in
parties to be fitted to artificial limbs. Strings of
sorry looking horses passed saying as plainly as
dumb creatures[td: c \td] could, ``Why in a city full of
them is there no \it{horse}pital for us?" Often a cart
came by with several rough coffins in it, and no
mourners following; barouches with invalid offi-
cers, rolled round the corner, and carriage loads of
pretty children with black coachmen, footmen,
and maids. The women who took their walks
abroad were so extinguished in three story bon-
nets, with overhanging balconies of flowers, that
their charms were obscured, and all I can say of
them is, that they dressed in the worst possible
taste, and walked like ducks.{l
   The men did the picturesque, and did it so well
that Washington looked like a mammoth mas-
querade. Spanish hats, scarlet lined riding cloaks,
swords and sashes, high boots and bright spurs,
beards and mustaches, which made plain faces
comely, and comely face heroic; these vanities of
the flesh transformed our butchers bakers and
candlestick makers into gallant riders of gaily cap-
risoned horses, much handsomer than themselves;
and dozens of such figures were constantly prane-
ing by with private prickings of spurs for the ben-
efit of the perambulating flower-bed. Some of
these gentlemen affected painfully tight uniforms
and little caps kept on by some new law of grav-
itation, as they covered only the bridge of the nowe
yet never fell off; the men looked like stuffed fowls,
and rode as if the safety of the nation depended
on their speed alone. The fattest, greyest officers
dressed most, and amb[i?]ed stat[?]ly along with or-
derlies behind, trying to look as if they didn't
know the stout party in front, and doing much
caracoling on thei own account.{l
   The mules were my especial delight, and an
hours' study of a constant succession of them in-
troduced me to many of their characteristics; for
six of these odd little beasts drew each army
wagon and went hopping like frogs through the
stream of mud that gently rolled along the street.
The coquettish mule had small feet, a nicely
trimmed ta[ss?]el of a tail, perked up ears, and
seemed much given to little tosses of the head,
affected skips and prances, and if they wore the
bells or were [bedizened?] with a bit of finery, put
on as many airs as any belle. The moral mule
was a stout, hard working creature, always tug-
giung with all its might, often pulling away after
the rest had stopped, laboring under a conscien-
tious delusion that food for the entire army de-
pended upon its private exertions. I respected
this style of mule, ahd had I possessed a juicy
cabbage, would have pressed it upon him with
thanks for his excellent example. The historical
mule was a melo-dramatic quadruped, prone to
startling humanity by erratic leaps, and wild
plunges, much shaking of his stubborn [head?], and
lashing out of his vicious heels; now and then
falling flat and apparently dying a la Forrest,\,a
gasp_a squirm_a flop, and so on till the street
was well blocked up, the drivers all swearing like
demons in [bad?] hats, and the chief actor's circula-
tion decidedly quickened by every variety of kick,
cuff, jerk and haul. When the last breath seemed
to have left his body and ``Doctors were in vain,"
a sudden resurrection takes place, and if ever a
mule laughed with scornful triumph, that was the
beast, as he leisurely rose, gave a comfortable
shake and calmly regarding the excited crowd
seemed to say_``A hit! a decided hit! for the
stupidest of animals has bamboozled a dozen men.
Now then! what are \it{you} stopping the way for?"
The pathetic mule was perhaps the most interest-
ing of all, for though he always seemed to be the
smallest, thinest, weakest of the six, the po[s?]til-
ion with big boots, long taile c[o?], and heavy
whip, was sure to bestride this one, who struggled
feebly along, head down, coat muddy and rough,
eye spiritless and sad, his very tail a mortified
stump, and the whole beast a picture of meek mis-
ery, fit to touch a heart of stone. The jovial mule
was a roly poly happy-go-lucky little piece of
horse flesh, taking everything easily from cudgel-
ing to caressing; strolling along[td: g a \td] with a roguish
twinkle of the eye, and if the thing were possible,
would have had his hands in his pockets and whis-
tled as he went. If there ever chanced to be an ap-
ple core, a stray turnip or whisp of hay in the gutter
this Mark Tapley was sure to find it, and none of
his mates seemed to begrudge him his bite. I sus-
pected this fellow was the peacemaker, confidant
and friend of all the others, for he had a sort of%
_``Cheer up, old boy, I'll pull you through"_%
look which was excessively engaging.{l
   Pigs also possessed attractions for me, never hav-
ing had an opportunity of observing their graces
of mind and manner, till I came to Washington,
whose porcine citizens appeared to enjoy a larger
liberty than many of its human ones. Stout, [?]-
date looking pigs hurried by each morning to their
places of business, with a preoccupied air and so-
norous greeting to their friends. Genteel pigs,
with an extra curl to their tails, promenaded in
pairs, lunching here and there like gentlemen of
leisure. Rowdy pigs pushed the passers by off
the\,side walk; tipsy pigs hiccoughed thier version
of ``We wont go home till morning," from the
gutter; and delicate young pigs tripped daintily
through the mud as if, like ``Mrs.P[??]rybingle,"
they plumed themselves upon their ankles and
kept themselves particularly neat in point of stock-
ings. maternal pigs, with their interesting fam[err: - \err]
ilies, strolled by in the sun, and often the pink
baby like little squealers lay down for a nap with
a trust in Providence worthy of human imitation.{l
   But more interesting than officers, ladies, m[??]
or pigs, were my colored brothers and sisters be-
cause so unlike the respectable members of society
I'd known in moral Boston.{l
   Here was the genuine article_no, not the gen-
uine article at all, we must go to Africa for that_%

but the sort of creatures generations of slavery
have made them; obsequious, trickish, lazy and
ignorant, yet kind hearted, merry tempered and
quick to feel and accept the least token of the
brotherly love which is slowly teaching the white
hand to grasp the black in this great struggle for
the liberty of both the races.{l
   Having been warned not to be too rampant on
the subject of slavery, as [seccah?] principles flour-
ished even under the respectable [nose?] of Father
Abraham, I had endeavored to walk discreetly
and curb my unruly member, looking about me
with all my eyes the while, and saving up the re-
sult of my observations for future use. I had not
been there a week before the neglected, devil-may-
care expression in many of the faces about me
seemed an urgent appeal to leave nursing white
bodies and take some care for these black souls.
Much as the lazy boys and saucy girls tormented
me, I liked them, and found that any show of in-
terest or friendliness brought out the better traits
which live in the most degraded and forsaken of
us all. I like their cheerfulness, for the dreariest
old hag who scrubbed all day in that pestilential
steam, gossipped and grinned all the way out,
when night set her free from drudgery. The girls
romped with their dusky sweethearts, or tossed
their babies with the tender pride that makes
mother-love a beautifier to the homeliest face.
The men and boys sang and whistled all day long,
and often, as I held my watch, the silence of the
night was sweetly broken by some chorus from
the street, full of real melody, whether the song
was of heaven or of hoe cakes; and, as I listened,
I felt that we never should doubt nor despair con-
cerning a race which through such bitter griefs
and wrongs still clings to this good gift, and seems
to solace with it the patient hearts that wait and
watch and hope until the end.{l
   I expect to have to defend myself from accu-
sations of a prejudice against color; but was sur-
prised to find things just the other way, and daily
shoked some neighbor by treating the blacks as
I did the whites. The men would swear at the
``darkies," would put two \it{gs} into negro, and scoff
at the idea of any good coming from such trash.
The nurses were willing to be served by the colored
people, but seldom thanked them, never praised,
and scarcely recognized them in the street; where-
at the blood of two generations of abolitionists
waxed hot in my veins, and at the first opportuni-
ty proclaimed itself, and asserted the right of free
speech as doggedly as the irrepressible Folsom her-
self.{l
   Happening to catch up a funny little black baby
who was toddling about the nurses' kitchen one
day, when I went down to make a mess for some
of my men, a Virginia woman standing by elevat-
ed her most prominent feature with a sniff of dis-
approbation, exclaiming,{l
   {``}Gracious, Miss P.! how can you? I've been
here six months and never so much as touched
the little toad with a poker."{l
   {``}More shame for you, ma'am," responded Miss
P., and with the natural perversity of a Yankee,
followe dup the blow by kissing ``the toad" with
ardor; his face was providentially [as clean and?]
shiny as if his mamma had just polished it up
with a corner of her apron and a drop from the
teakettle spout, like old Aunt Chloe. This [??h]
act, and the anti-slavery lecture that followed,
while one hand stirred gruel for sick Americans and
the other hugged baby Africa, did not produce the
cheering result which I [fondly?] expected, for my
comrade henseforth regarded me as a [dangerous?]
[??tic?], and my proteg\`e [nearly came to his death?]
by [insisting on swarming up stairs to my room on?]
all occasions, and being walked on like [a little?]
black spider.{l
   I waited for New Year's day with [more eagerness?]
than I had ever known before; and, [though it?]
brought me no gift, I felt rich in the [act of justice?]
so [tardily?] performed tow[ard some of those about?]
me. As the bells rang midnight, I [electrified my?]
room-mate by dancing out of bed, throwing
up the window and [flapping my handkerchief?]
with a [feeble cheer in answer to the shout of?]
a group of colored [men in the street below. All?]
night they tooted and [tramped, f?? crackers? sun]
``Glory Hallelujah," and took [comfort, poor souls!?]
in their own way. The sky was clear, the [moon?]
shone benignly, a mild wind blew across the river,
and all good [omens seemed to maher? in the ?]
of the day whose noontide cannot now be long in
coming. If the colored people had taken hands
and danced around the White House, with a few
cheers for the much [?? gentlem?n who has]
immortalized himself by one [? act, no President?]
could have had a finer [??ee], or one to be prouder
of.
   While these sights and sounds were going on
without, curious scenes were [passing?] within, and I
was learning that one of the best methods of [?]t-
ting oneself to be a nurse in a hospital[td: sp \td] is to be a
patient there; for then only can one wholly [??]
what the men suffer and sigh for, how acts of
kindness touch and win, how much or little we are
to those about us, and for the first time really see
that in coming there we have taken our lives in
our hands, and may have to pay dearly for a brief
experience. Every one was very kind; the attend-
ants of my ward often came up to report progress,
to [fill my wood-box, or bring ??? and ???]-
ents from my boys. The [nurses ?? ??]
with those tired [?? of ??, and ?? ??]
each evening to chat over my fire and [make things?]
cozy for the night. The doctors [paid daily? ?]
tapped at my lungs to see if pneumonia was w?]
in, left doses without [names, and ???
ing me as ignorant and [much more ??]
than when they came. Hours began to [get con-?]
fused, people looked odd, queer [?? ??]
the room, and the nights were one long fight with
weariness and pain. Letters[td: tt \td] from home [grew ??]
io[us?], the doctors lifted their eyebrows and [nodded?]
ominously, friends said ``Don't stay," [and our ??-]
ternal rebellion succeeded the advice; [but the three?]
months were not out, and the [idea of giving up on?]
soon was proclaimining a [defeat before I was ??]
[ro??ted], so to all ``Don't stays" I [opposed ``I wills,"?]
till one fine morning a gr[ay headed gentleman? ??]
like a welcome ghost on my [hearth, and at the??]
sight of him my [resolution? melted away, my heart??]
turned traitor to my [boys?, and when ???]
``Come home," I answered, ``Yes, [father," and on?]
ended my career [as an army nurse.]{l
   I never shall regret the [going, h??a ??]
[t?] with typhoid, [ten? dolalrs and a wig are all]
the visible [results of the experiment; ? ?]
may live and learn much in a [month; a good fit?]
of illness proves the value of health, [real ??]
tries one's [mettle?], and self-sacrifice [??]
acter. Let no one who sincerely [desires to help?]
the work on in this way, delay going [through any?]
fear, for the worth of life lies in the [experiences]
that fill it, and this is one which cannot be [forgot-?]
te[n?]. All that is best and bravest in the hearts of
men and women comes out in scenes like them
and though a hosptial is a rough school, its [lessons?]
are both stern and [salutary?], and the [building of?]
pupils there, in proportion to his [fa???]
learns a deeper faith in God and in [himself. I, for?]
one, would return tomorrow, on the [``up again and?]
take another" principle, if I could, [for the ??]
of pleasure and profit I got out of that [??]
compen[?tes] for all after pangs; and, though a]
sadly womanish feeling, I take some satisfaction in
the thought that if I could not lay my head on the?]
altar of my country, I have my [hair, and that is?]
more than handsome Helen did for her [? ?-]
band, when she sacrificed only the ends of her ring-
ets on his urn. Therefore I close this little [chap-?]
ter of hospital experiences with the [?? that they]
were not better worth recording, [and add the po-?]
etical gem with which I console myself for [the un?-]
timely demise of ``Nurse Periwinkle:"{l
{\qquad}``Oh lay her in a little pit,}q
{\qquad}With a marble stone to cover it;}q
{\qquad}And carve thereon a gruel spoon,}q
{\qquad}To show a ``nu[?]" has died too soon."}q
