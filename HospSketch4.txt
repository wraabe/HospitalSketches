   \it{My} \it{Dear} \it{S,:}_As inquiries like your own have
come to me from various frendly readers of the
Sketches, I will answer them \it{en} \it{masse}, and in
printed form, as a sort of postscript to what[td: h\td] has
gone before. One of these questions was, ``Are
there no services by hospital death-beds, or on
Sundays?"{l
   In most Hospitals I hope there are; in ours the
men died and were carried away with as little cere-
mony as on a battle-field. The first event of this
kind which I witnessed was so very brief, and bare
of anything like reverence, sorrow, or pious con-
solation, that I heartily agreed with the bluntly
expressed opinion of a Maine man lying next his
comrade, who died with no visible help near him
but a compassionate woman and a tender-hearted
Irishman, who dropped upon his knees and told
his beads with Catholic feror[td: v \td] for the good of his
Protestant brother's parting soul:{l
   {``}If after gettin' all the hard kicks we are left to
die this way with nothing but a Paddy's prayers
to help us, I guess Christians are rather [scarce?]
round Washington."{l
   I thought so too, but though Miss Faithful, one
of my mates, anxious that souls should be minis-
tered to as well as bodies, spoke more than once to
the Chaplain, nothing came of it. Unlike another
Shepherd whose earnest piety weekly purified the
Senate Chamber, this man did not feed as well as
fold his flock, nor make himself a human symbol
of the Great Samaritan who never passes by on
the other side.{l
   Occasionally on a Sunday afternoon, such of the
nurses, officers, attendants, and patients as could
avail themselves of it, were gathered in the Ball
Room for an hour's service, of which the singing
was the better part. To me it seemed that if ever
strong, wise, and loving words were needed, it was
then; if ever mortal man had living texts before
his eyes to illustrate and illuminate his thought, it
was there; and if ever hearts were prompted to
devoutest self-ab[?]egation it was in the work which
brought us to anything but a Chapel of E[a?]se. But
some spiritual paralysis seemed to have befallen
our pastor, for though many faces turned toward
him full of the dumb hunger that often comes to
men when suffering or danger brings them nearer
to the heart of things, they were offered the chaff
of divinity, and its wheat was left for less needy
gleaners who knew where to look. Even the fine
old Bible stories[td: t \td], which may be made as life-like
as any history of our day by a vivid fancy and
pictorial diction, were robbed of all their charms
by dry explanations and literal applications[td: o \td], in-
stead of being useful and pleasant lessons to these
men whom weakness had rendered as docile as
children in a father's hands.{l
   I watched the listless countenances all about me
while a mild Daniel was moralizing in a den of
utterly uninteresting lions; while Shadrach, Me-
shech, and Abednego were leisurely passing
through the fiery furnace, where I sadly feared
some of us sincerely wished they had remained as
permanencies; while the Temple of Solomon was
laboriously erected with minute descriptions of
the process, and any quantity of bells and pome-
grantes on the [raiment?] of the priests. Listless
they were at the beginning, and listless at the end,
but the instant some stirring old hymn was given
out, sleepy eyes brightened, lounging figures sat
erect, and many a poor lad rose up in his bed, or
stretched an eager hand for the book, while all
broke out with a heartiness that proved that some-
where at the core of even the mos abandoned
there still glowed some remnant of the native piety
that flows in music from the heart of every little
child. Even the big rebel joined, and boomed
away in a thunderous bass, singing_%
{\qquad}``Salvation! let the echoes fly,"}q
as energetically as if he felt the need of a speedy
execution of the command.{l
   That was the pleasant moment of the hour, for
then it seemed a homelike and happy spot; the
groups of men looking over one another's shoulders
as they sang, the few silent figures in the beds,
here and there a woman noiselessly performing
some necessary duty, and singing as she worked,
while in the arm chair standing in the midst I
placed for my own satisfaction the imaginary like-
ness of a certain faithful pastor who took all out-
casts by the hand, smote the devil in whatever
guise he came, and comforted the indigent in spir-
it with the best wisdom of a great[td: t \td] and tender heart
which still speaks to us from its Italian grave.
With that addition my picture was complete, and
I often longed to take a veritable sketch of a Hos-
pital Sunday, for despite its drawbacks, consisting
of continue labor, the want of proper books, the
barren preaching that bore no fruit, this day was
never like the other six.{l
   True to their home training our New England
boys did their best[td: b \td] to make it what it should be.
With many there was much reading of Testaments,
humming over of favorite hymns, and looking at
such books as I could call from a miscellaneous
library. Some lay idle, slept, or gossiped, yet
when I came to them for a quiet evening chat, they
often talked freely and well of themselves; would
blunder out some timid hope that their troubles
might ``do 'em good and keep 'em stiddy," would
choke a little as they said good night and turned
their faces to the wall to think of mother, wife, or
home; these human ties seeming to be the most
vital religion which they yet knew. I observed
that some of them did not wear their caps on this
day, though at other times they clung to them like
Quakers; wearing them in bed, putting them on to
read the paper, eat an apple, or write a letter, as if
like a new sort of Samson their strengh lay not in
their hair but in their hats. Many read no novels,
swore less, were more silent, orderly and cheerful,
as if the Lord were an invisible Ward-master who
went his rounds but once a week, and must find all
things at their best. I like all this in the poor
ough boys, and could have found it in my heart
to have put down sponge and teapot and preached
a little sermon then and there, while homesickness
and pain had made these natures soft, that some
good see might be cast therein to blossom and
bear fruit here or hereafter.{l
   Regarding the admission of friends to nurse
their sick, I can only say it was not allowed at
Hurlyburly House; though one indomitable pa-
rent took my ward by storm adn held her posi-
tion in spite of Doctors, Matron, and Nurse Peri-
winkle. Though it was against the rules, though
the culpret was an acid, frost bitten female, though
the young man would havedone quite as well with-
out her anxious fussiness, and the whole room
[fuL?] been much more comfortable, there was some-
thing so irresistible in this persistent devotion
that no one had the heart to oust her from her
post. She slept on the floor without uttering a
complaint, bore jokes somewhat of the rudest,
fared scantily, though her basket was daily filled
with luxuries for her boy, and tended that petu-
lant personage with a never falling patience beau-
tiful to see.{l
   I feel a glow of moral rectitude in saying this of
her, for though a perfect pelican to her young,
she pecked and cackled (I don't know that peli-
cans express their[td: t \td] emotions in that manner,)
most obstreperously when others invaded her
premises, and led me a wearly life with ``George's
tea-rusks, George's foot bath, George's measles,
and George's mother," till, after a smart passage
of arms and tongues with the matron, she wrath-
fully packed up her rusks, her son and herself,
and departed in an ambulance, scolding to the
very last.{l
   I am gratified to find that my little Sergeant has
found favor in several quarters, and gladly respond
to sundry calls for news of him, though my per-
sonal knowledge ended five months ago. Next to
my good John_I hope the grass is green about
him far away there in Virginia!_I placed the Ser-
geant on my list of worthy boys[td: s \td], and many a
jovial chat have I enjoyed with the merry hearted
lad, who had a fancy for fun, when his poor arm
was dressed. While Dr. P. poked and strapped I
brushed the remains of the Sergeants' brown mane%
_shorn sorely against his will_and gossiped with
all my might, the boy making odd faces, excla-
mations and appeals when nerves got the better
of nonsense as they sometimes did.{l
   {``}I'd rather laugh than cry when I must sing
out any how, so just say that bit from Dickens
again, please, and I'll stand it like a man." He
did, for ``Mrs. Cl[u?]ppins" ``Chadband" and ``Sam
Weller" always helped him though; thereby
causing me to lay another offering of love and
admiration on the shrine of the god of my idola-
try, though he does wear too much jewelry and
talk slang.{l
   The Sergeant also originated I believe, the fash-
ion of calling his neighbors by their afflictions in-
stead of their names, and I was rather taken
aback by hearing them bandy remarks of this
sort with perfect good humor and much enjoy-
ment of the new game.{l
   {``}Hallo, old Fits is off again! ``How are you,
Rheumatiz? ``Will you trade apples, Ribs?" `I say,
Miss P. may I give Typhus a drink of this?"
``Look here No toes, lend us a stamp, there's a
good feller." etc. He himself was christened
``Baby B." because he tended his arm on a little
pillow and called it his infant.{l
   Very fussy about his grub was Sergeant B., and
much trotting of attendants was necessary when
he partook of nourishment. Anything more irre-
sistably wheedlesome I never saw, and constantly
found myself indulging him like the most week
minded parent, merely for the pleasure of seeing
his brown eyes twinkle, her merry mouth break
into a smile, and his one hand execute a jaunty
little salute that was entirely captivating. I am
afraid that nurse P., damaged her dignity frolick-
ing with this persuasive youn gentleman, though
done for his well being; but ``boys will be boys,"
is perfectly applicable to the case; for in spite of
years, sex, and the ``prunes and prisms" doctrine
lad down for our use, I have a fellow feeling for
lads, and always owed fate a grudge because I
wasn't a lord of creation instead of a lady.
   Since I left I have heard from a reliable source
that my Sergeant has gone home; therefore the
small romance that budded the first day I saw
him, has blossomed into its second chapter, and I
now imagine ``dearest Jane" filling my place, tend-
ing the wounds I tended,brushing the curly jungle
I brushed, loving the excellent little youth I loved,
and eventually walking [altar?]ward with the Ser-
geant stumping gallantly at he side. If she
doesn't do all this and no end more, I'll never for-
give her; and sincerely pray to the guardian saint
of lovers that ``Baby B.," may prosper in his woo-
ing, and his name be long in the land.{l
One of the lively episodes of hospital life is the
frequent marching away of such as are well
enough to rejoin their regiments, or betake them-
selves to some convalescent camp. The ward mas-
ter comes to the door of each room that he is to
be thinned, reads off a list of names, bids their
owners look sharp and be ready when called for,
and as he vanishes, the rooms fall into an inde-
scribable state of topsy-turvyness, as the boys be-
gin to black their boots, brighten spurs if they
have them, overhaul knapsacks, make presents,
are fitted out with needfuls, fed, and_well why
not?_kissed sometimes, as they say, good by, for
in all human probability we shall never meet
again, and a woman't heart yearns over anything
that has clung to her for help and comfort. I
never liked these breakings up of my little house-
hold, though my short stay showed me but three.
I was immensely gratified by the hand shakes I
got, for their somewhat painful cordiality [assured?]
me that I had not tried in vain. The big Prussian
rumbled out his unintelligible \it{adieux} with a grate-
ful face and a premonitory smooth of his yellow
moustache, but got no farther, for some one else
stepped up with a large brown hand extended, and
this recommendation of our very faulty establish-
ment_{l
   {``}We\/'re off, ma'am, and I'm powerful sorry for
I'd no idea a orspital was such a jolly place. Hope
I'll git another ball somewheres easy, so I'll come
back, and be took care on again. Mean, ain't
it?"{l
   I didn't think so, but the doctrine of inglorious
ease was not the right one to preach up, so I tried
to look shocked, failed signally, and consoled my-
self by giving him the fat pincushion he had ad-
mired as the ``cutest little machine agoin." Then
they fell into line in front of the house, looking
rather wan and feeble some of them, but trying to
step out smartly and march in good order, though
half the knapsacks were carried by the guard, and
several leaned on sticks instead of shouldering
guns. All looked up and smiled, or waved their
hands and touched their caps, as they assed under
our windows down the long street, and so away,
some to their homes in this world and some to that
in the next; and for the rest of the day I felt like
Rachel mourning for her children, when I saw the
empty beds and missed the familiar faces.{l
   You ask if nurses are obliged to witness amp[u?]-
tations and such matters as a part of their duty?
I think not, unless they wish, for the patient is un-
der the effects of ether, and needs no care but such
as the surgeons can best give. Our work begins
afterward, when teh poor soul comes to himself,
sick, faint, and wandering; full of strange pains
and confused visions, of disagreeable sensations
and sights. Then we must sooth and sustain, tend
and watch; preaching and practicing patience, till
sleep and time have restored courage and self-con-
trol.{l
   I witnessed several operations, for the height of
my ambition was to go to the front after a battle,
and feeling that t\/he sooner I i[nured?] myself to try-
ing sights the more useful I should be. Several of
my mates shrank from such things, for though the
spirit was wholly willing the flesh was inconvenient-
ly weak. One funereal lady came to try her pow-
ers as a nurse, but a brief conversation eliciting
the facts that she fainted at the sight of blood, was
afraid to watch alone, couldn't possibly take care
of delirous[td: e \td] persons, was nervous about infections
and unable to bear much fatigue: she was mildly
dismissed. I hope she found her sphere, but fancy
a comfortable bandbox on a high shelf would best
meet the requirements of her case.{l
   Dr. Z. was anxious that I should witness a dis-
section; but I never accepted his invitations, think-
ing that my nerves belonged to the living, not the
dead, and I had better finish my education as a
nurse before I began that of a surgeon. But I
never met the little man skipping through the hall,
with oddly shaped cases in his hand, and an ab-
sorbed expression of countenance, without being
sure that a select party of surgeons were at work
in the dead house, which idea was a rather trying
one, wh[eh?] I knew the subject was some person
whom I had nursed and cared for.{l
   To such as wish to know where these scenes took
place, I must respect[s?]ully decline to answer; for
Hurlyburly House has ceased to exist as a hospi-
tal; so let it rest with all its sins upon its head,%
_perhaps I should say chimner top. When the
nurses fell ill, the doctors departed, and the pa-
tients got well, I believe the co[n?]cern [gently?] faded
from existence, or was merged into some other and
better establishment, where I hope the washing of
three hundred sick people is done out of the house[,?]
the food is eatable, and mortal women are not ex-
pected to possess an angelic exemption fro\/ all
wants, and the endurance of tr[a?]ck horses.{l
   The next hospital I enter will, I hope, be one for
the colored regiments, as they seem to be proving
their right to the admiration and kind offices of
their white relations, who owe them so large a
debt.{l
   Yours, with a firm faith in the good time com-
ing.[large space] \sc{Tribulation} \sc{Periwinkle}.{l
